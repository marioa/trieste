## 1. Introduction

* 1.1 Which of the following are valid R-names?
    * `min_height` - valid.
    * `max.height` - valid.
    * `_age` - not valid, must starts with either a letter or a dot not followed by a number.
    * `.mass` - valid.
    * `MaxLength` - valid.
    * `min-length` - valid.
    * `2widths` - not valid, starts with a number.
    * `celsius2kelvin` - valid.

* 1.2 What will be the value of each variable after each statement in the following program?
    * `mass <- 47.5` - 47.5
    * `age <- 122` - 122.
    * `mass <- mass * 2.3` - 109.25
    * `age <- age - 20` - 102.

* 1.3 Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI for a person)

```R
height <- 1.72               # height in metres
weight <- 82                 # weight in kg
bmi    <-  weight/height^2   # bmi is the weight divided by the square of the height.
# or
bmi <- weight/(height*height)
```

## 2. Project Management

* 2.1.1 Create a new git enabled project

 Create a new empty project `my_project2`. Make sure that this is git enabled.

Add a `Readme.md` file (`File -> New File -> Text file`) with the following  text:

```
# My test project

This is my test Trieste repository.
```

then on Studio:

```
 File -> Save As...
```

 Call the file `Readme.md`. Save it at the root directory.
 Switch to the git window.  Add and commit this file with the `.gitignore` file. On RStudio see `Help->Markdown quick reference` to see what can be done.

* 2.1.2 Create GitHub repository and push the contents

 Go to your GitHub account and create a new repository for `my_project2`. When you create your project you should get instructions on how to push an existing project to GitHub. On the Git panel click on the `More` menu item and select `Shell...`. This will open up a shell command in the your new project directory. Type the commands GitHub is suggesting to you there (this should push up your project content to GitHub). You should now see your content on GitHub.

* 2.1.3 Modify your `Readme.md`

Modify your `Readme.md` file (add/remove content as you like). Save the file, commit the file (go to the Git panel select the file and then click on Commit). A window will come up where you need to put in a sensible commit message. Once this is done click on the Push button and that should push the contents to GitHub - do you see those changes?

* 2.1.4 Remotely modify your `Readme.md`

On GitHub click on the `Readme.md` file. Select Edit (the pencil), modify the content and save (add a sensible commit message there as well).

In RStudio, click on the Pull button. Do you see the changes you made being ported back to your local `Readme.md` version?

* 2.1.5 Ignoring files

 1. Create a directory within your project called graphs (in the files view click on the `New Folder` item).
 2. Modify the `.gitignore` file to contain graphs/ so that this disposable output isn’t versioned.
 3. Commit your `.gitignore` file.
 4. Push the content.

If you have managed to do all these steps you should now be in a position to  use Rstudio with GitHub (or any other remote git repository).

## 3. Getting help

* 3.1.1 what does the `c` function do? What do the following give you?
```R
c(1, 2, 3)
c('d', 'e', 'f')
c(1, 2, 'f')
```
These are called vectors, more about these later.

* 3.1.2 what does the `paste` function do?
```R
x <- c("fred","john")              # Create a vector 
paste(x,"one","two","three")
```
 What do the optional arguments "sep" and "collapse" do?
 i.e. `paste(x,"one","two","three", sep="-")` <br/>
What is the difference between `paste` and `paste0`?

*  3.1.3: how would you read a comma separated values (csv) type file that is tab (`\t`) delimited instead?<br/>
    **Hint**: use `??csv` to see what is available.

## 4. Data Structures

* 4.1.1 Coerce `character_coerced_to_numeric` to integers.

  ```R
  as.integer(character_coerced_to_numeric)
  ```

* 4.2.1 Do the following:

  1. Make a vector with the numbers 1 to 26.

     ```
     (myvec <- 1:26)
     ```

  2. Multiply these by 2.

     ```R
     (myvec <- myvec *2 )
     ```

  3. Name the elements (there is a built in vector called `letters` for small case letters `LETTERS` for capitals).

     ```R
     names(myvec) <- letters
     myvec
     # or if yu want to use capitals
     names(myvec) <- LETTERS
     myvec
     ```

* 4.2.2 What do you think the following will give you?

  ```R
  x <- seq(1,4)
  x+1
  [1] 2 3 4 5
  ```

  So what do you think the following will give you?

  ```R
  y <- seq(1,2)
  x+y
  [1] 2 4 4 6
  ```

  This happens because, as the `y` vector fits it is recycled so you get:

  ```
  (x[1]+y[1]]) (x[2]+y[1]]) (x[2]+y[1]]) (x[3]+y[1]]) (x[4]+y[2]])
  ```

  What about:

  ```R
  x*y
  [1] 1 4 3 8
  ```

  Similarly:

  ```
  (x[1]*y[1]]) (x[2]*y[1]]) (x[2]*y[1]]) (x[3]*y[1]]) (x[4]*y[2]])
  ```

* 4.3.1 The default behaviour for `read.csv` is to read strings as factors. Look up the documentation to find ways of not reading strings as factors.

  ```R
  cats <-read.csv(file="../data/feline-data.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
  ```

  Create a new vector that recovers the values from `factor_of_myvals`. Remember if you just use `as.integer` you get the index of the factor and not the values. 

  **Hint**: think of `as.character` but we do not want characters.

  ```R
  myvals <- c(1,2,3,3,2,1,10,2,5)
  factor_of_myvals <- factor(myvals)
  as.integer(as.character(factor_of_myvals))
  [1]  1  2  3  3  2  1 10  2  5
  ```

* 4.3.2 factors are good for doing quick plots:

  ```R
  animals <- factor(c("dog","cat","dog","cow","dog","dog","dog","rabbit"))
  plot(animals)
  ```

  ![Resulting plot](imgs/animals.png)

  Look up the documentation for plot and to this diagram do the following:

  1. Add a plot title "Farm yard animals"

  2. Add an x-axis title "Animals"

  3. Add a y-axis title "Numbers"

  4. Change the colour of the bars to "red"

  5. Reverse the ordering of the labels (this are coming from the levels) so you get "rabbit","dog","cow", "cat".

     ```R
     animals <- factor(c("dog","cat","dog","cow","dog","dog","dog","rabbit"),
                      levels=c("rabbit","dog","cow", "cat"))
     plot(animals, main="Farm yard animals",xlab="Animals",
          ylab="Numbers", col="red")
     ```

     ![New plot of animals](imgs/animals2.png)

* 4.4.1 What do the following give you and what types do they return? Use `typeof()`, `class()` and `str()`

  ```R
  cats[1]
  cats[[1]]
  cats$coat
  cats["coat"]
  cats[1, 1]
  cats[, 1]
  cats[1, ]
  
  typeof(cats[1]); class(cats[1]); str(cats[1])
  [1] "list"
  [1] "data.frame"
  'data.frame':	3 obs. of  1 variable:
   $ coat: Factor w/ 3 levels "black","calico",..: 2 1 3
  
  typeof(cats[[1]]); class(cats[[1]]); str(cats[[1]])
  [1] "integer"
  [1] "factor"
   Factor w/ 3 levels "black","calico",..: 2 1 3
  
   typeof(cats$coat); class(cats$coat); str(cats$coat)
  [1] "integer"
  [1] "factor"
   Factor w/ 3 levels "black","calico",..: 2 1 3
  
  typeof(cats[1,1]); class(cats[1,1]); str(cats[1,1])
  [1] "integer"
  [1] "factor"
   Factor w/ 3 levels "black","calico",..: 2
  
  typeof(cats[,1]); class(cats[,1]); str(cats[,1])
  [1] "integer"
  [1] "factor"
   Factor w/ 3 levels "black","calico",..: 2 1 3
  
  typeof(cats[1,]); class(cats[1,]); str(cats[1,])
  [1] "list"
  [1] "data.frame"
  'data.frame':	1 obs. of  3 variables:
   $ coat        : Factor w/ 3 levels "black","calico",..: 2
   $ weight      : num 2.1
   $ likes_string: logi TRUE
  ```

* 4.5.1 What do you think will be the result of `length(matrix_example)`? 

  ```R
  length(matrix_example)
  [1] 18
  ```

* Make another matrix, this time containing the numbers 1:50 with 5 columns and 10 rows. Did the matrix function fill your matrix by column, or by row, as its default behaviour? Can you get it to fill the matrix the other way round?

  ```R
  (m <- matrix(1:50,ncol=5))
        [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
   [1,]    1   11   21   31   41
   [2,]    2   12   22   32   42
   [3,]    3   13   23   33   43
   [4,]    4   14   24   34   44
   [5,]    5   15   25   35   45
   [6,]    6   16   26   36   46
   [7,]    7   17   27   37   47
   [8,]    8   18   28   38   48
   [9,]    9   19   29   39   49
  [10,]   10   20   30   40   50
  
  (m <- matrix(1:50,ncol=5,byrow=TRUE))
        [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
   [1,]    1    2    3    4    5
   [2,]    6    7    8    9   10
   [3,]   11   12   13   14   15
   [4,]   16   17   18   19   20
   [5,]   21   22   23   24   25
   [6,]   26   27   28   29   30
   [7,]   31   32   33   34   35
   [8,]   36   37   38   39   40
   [9,]   41   42   43   44   45
  [10,]   46   47   48   49   50
  ```

* 4.5.3 Create a list of length two containing a character vector for each of the sections in this part of the workshop:

  * Data types:
    * 'double', 'complex', 'integer', 'character', 'logical'
  * Data structures:
    * 'data.frame', 'vector', 'factor', 'list', 'matrix'

  Populate each character vector with the names of the data types and data structures we’ve seen so far.

  ```R
  (mytypes <- list(
      dataTypes=c('double', 'complex', 'integer', 'character', 'logical'),
      dataStructs=c('double', 'complex', 'integer', 'character', 'logical')))
  
  $dataTypes
  [1] "double"    "complex"   "integer"   "character" "logical"  
  
  $dataStructs
  [1] "double"    "complex"   "integer"   "character" "logical" 
  ```

* 5.4 Consider the R output of the matrix below:

  ```
        [,1] [,2]
  [1,]    4    1
  [2,]    9    5
  [3,]   10    7
  ```

  What was the correct command used to write this matrix? Examine each command and try to figure out the correct one before running them. Think about what matrices the other commands will produce.

  ```R
  matrix(c(4, 1, 9, 5, 10, 7), nrow = 3)
  matrix(c(4, 9, 10, 1, 5, 7), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
  matrix(c(4, 9, 10, 1, 5, 7), nrow = 2)
  matrix(c(4, 1, 9, 5, 10, 7), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE) # This one
  ```

* 5.5 Consider:

  ```R
  m1 <- matrix(seq(1,16),ncol=4,nrow=4)
  m2 <- matrix(seq(16,1,-1),ncol=4,nrow=4)
  ```

  If you multiply these you get an elementwise multiplication:

  ```R
  m1*m2
       [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
  [1,]   16   60   72   52
  [2,]   30   66   70   42
  [3,]   42   70   66   30
  [4,]   52   72   60   16
  ```

  How would you get a proper get a proper matrix-matrix product? This is a question about using help (you don't have to understand matrix multiplication), remember "??" ?

  ```R
  m1 %*% m2
       [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
  [1,]  386  274  162   50
  [2,]  444  316  188   60
  [3,]  502  358  214   70
  [4,]  560  400  240   80
  ```



## 5. Exploring data frames

* 5.5.1 Remove the duplicated lines we added to the data frame

  ```
  cats[c(1:4,9),]
             coat weight likes_string age
  1        calico    2.1         TRUE   4
  2         black    5.0        FALSE   5
  3         tabby    3.2         TRUE   8
  4 tortoiseshell    3.3         TRUE   9
  9      Cheshire    0.0         TRUE 152
  
  unique(cats)
             coat weight likes_string age
  1        calico    2.1         TRUE   4
  2         black    5.0        FALSE   5
  3         tabby    3.2         TRUE   8
  4 tortoiseshell    3.3         TRUE   9
  9      Cheshire    0.0         TRUE 152
  ```

* 5.5.2 You can create a data frame using

  ```R
  df <- data.frame(id = c('a', 'b', 'c'),
                   x = 1:3,
                   y = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE),
                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
  ```

  Create your own data frame that contains your:

  * first name
  * last name
  * lucky number

  Use `rbind` to add information for the people next to you. Use `cbind` to add an extra column specifying whether they prefer "tea", "coffee","juice" or "water".

* 5.1.3 Create a `cats2` data frame that re-arranges the order of the columns of `cats` to have "weight", "coat", "likes_string", "age" data frame. Rename the columns of `cats2` to use the capital` LETTERS` starting from N and use every second letter, i.e. N (letter 14),P,R and T.

  ```R
  (cats2 <- unique(cats[c("weight", "coat", "likes_string", "age")]))
    weight          coat likes_string age
  1    2.1        calico         TRUE   4
  2    5.0         black        FALSE   5
  3    3.2         tabby         TRUE   8
  4    3.3 tortoiseshell         TRUE   9
  9    0.0      Cheshire         TRUE 152
  
  names(cats2) <- LETTERS[seq(14,20,2)]
  cats2
      N             P     R   T
  1 2.1        calico  TRUE   4
  2 5.0         black FALSE   5
  3 3.2         tabby  TRUE   8
  4 3.3 tortoiseshell  TRUE   9
  9 0.0      Cheshire  TRUE 152
  ```

* 5.2.1 Go to `File -> New file -> R` script, and write an R script to load in the gapminder dataset. Put it in the scripts/ directory and add it to version control.

  Run the script using the `source` function, using the file path as its argument (or by pressing the “source” button in RStudio).

  

* 5.2.2 Read the output of `str(gapminder)` again; this time, use what you’ve learned about factors, lists and vectors, as well as the output of functions like `colnames` and `dim` to explain what everything that `str` prints out for gapminder means. If there are any parts you can’t interpret, discuss with your neighbors!

  ```
  str(gapminder)
  'data.frame':	1704 obs. of  6 variables:
   $ country  : Factor w/ 142 levels "Afghanistan",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
   $ year     : int  1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977 1982 1987 1992 1997 ...
   $ pop      : num  8425333 9240934 10267083 11537966 13079460 ...
   $ continent: Factor w/ 5 levels "Africa","Americas",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...
   $ lifeExp  : num  28.8 30.3 32 34 36.1 ...
   $ gdpPercap: num  779 821 853 836 740 
   
   dim(gapminder)
  [1] 1704    6
  ```

  

## 6. Subsetting data

*  6.1.1 Given the following code:

```R
x <- c(5.4, 6.2, 7.1, 4.8, 7.5)
names(x) <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
print(x)
```

Come up with at least 3 different commands that will produce the following output:

```R
b   c   d 
6.2 7.1 4.8

x[c(2,3,4)]
  b   c   d 
6.2 7.1 4.8 

x[2:4]
  b   c   d 
6.2 7.1 4.8 

x[seq(2,4)]
  b   c   d 
6.2 7.1 4.8 

x[c("b","c","d")]
  b   c   d 
6.2 7.1 4.8 
```

After you find 3 different commands, compare notes with your neighbour. Did you have different strategies?

* 6.2.1 Given the following code:

```R
x <- c(5.4, 6.2, 7.1, 4.8, 7.5)
names(x) <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
print(x)
```

What do you expect the following give you?

```R
x[-which(names(x) == "g")]
named numeric(0)
```

Did this match your expectation? Why did we get this result?

```R
which(names(x) == "g")
integer(0)
```

**Tip**: test out each part of the command on it’s own - this is a useful debugging strategy.

* 6.2.1 Which of the following are true:

  * if there are no `TRUE` values passed to `which`, an empty vector is returned. **TRUE**

  ```R
  which(FALSE)
  integer(0)
  ```

  * if there are no TRUE values passed to which, an error message is shown. **FALSE** (see above)

  * `integer()` is an empty vector. **TRUE**

    ```R
    integer()
    integer(0)
    ```

  * making an empty vector negative produces an “everything” vector. **FALSE**

  ```R
  x <- 1:10
  x[-integer(0)]
  integer(0)
  ```

  * `x[]` gives the same result as `x[integer()]`. **FALSE**

  ```
  x[]
   [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
  
  x[integer()]
  integer(0)
  ```

* 6.3.1 Write a subsetting command to return the values in `x` that are greater than 4 and less than 7 for the following code:

  ```R
  x <- c(5.4, 6.2, 7.1, 4.8, 7.5)
  names(x) <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
  print(x)
  
    a   b   c   d   e 
  5.4 6.2 7.1 4.8 7.5 
  
  x[4<x & x<7]
    a   b   d 
  5.4 6.2 4.8 
  ```

* 6.4.1 Given the following code:

```R
m <- matrix(1:18, nrow=3, ncol=6)
print(m)

     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6]
[1,]    1    4    7   10   13   16
[2,]    2    5    8   11   14   17
[3,]    3    6    9   12   15   18
```

Which of the following commands will extract the values 11 and 14?

```R
m[2,4,2,5]  # A.
m[2:5]      # B.
m[4:5,2]    # C.
m[2,c(4,5)] # D. <------
```

* 6.4.2 For the following matrix:

```R
m <- matrix(data=1:16,nrow=4)
m

     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    5    9   13
[2,]    2    6   10   14
[3,]    3    7   11   15
[4,]    4    8   12   16
```

you can use `rownames(m`) and `colnames(m)` to inspect/set the rownams/colnames. Also remember the built-in arrays: `letters` and `LETTERS`. Use these to name the rows to use small letters and the columns with large letters. Use the row and column names to dereference the entry that has the value 16.

```
rownames(m) <- LETTERS[1:4]
colnames(m) <- letters[1:4]
m
  a b  c  d
A 1 5  9 13
B 2 6 10 14
C 3 7 11 15
D 4 8 12 16

 m["D","d"]
[1] 16
```

* 6.4.3 For the previous array only print out values that lie between 6 and 10.

```R
m[6<m & m<10]
[1] 7 8 9
```

* Set the values outside 6 to 10 range to 0 and print these - best to work on a copy of the data.

```R
m2 <- m
m2[m2<6 | m2 > 10] <- 0
m2
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    0    0    8    0
[2,]    0    0    7    0
[3,]    0   10    6    0
[4,]    0    9    0    0
```

* 6.5.1 Given the following list:

```R
xlist <- list(a = "Software Carpentry", b = 1:10, data = head(iris))
```

Using your knowledge of both list and vector subsetting, extract the number 2 from `xlist`. **Hint**: the number 2 is contained within the `b` item in the list.

```R
xlist
$a
[1] "Software Carpentry"

$b
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10

$data
  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa
4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa
5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa
6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa

xlist$b[2]
[1] 2
```

* 6.5.2 Given a linear model:

```R
mod <- aov(pop ~ lifeExp, data=gapminder)
```

 Extract the residual degrees of freedom (**hint**: `attributes()` will help you).

```R
attributes(mod)
$names
 [1] "coefficients"  "residuals"     "effects"       "rank"          "fitted.values" "assign"        "qr"            "df.residual"  
 [9] "xlevels"       "call"          "terms"         "model"        

$class
[1] "aov" "lm" 

mod$df.residual
[1] 1702
```

* 6.6.1 Fix each of the following common data frame subsetting errors:

  * Extract observations collected for the year 1957

    ```R
    gapminder[gapminder$year = 1957,]
    Error: unexpected '=' in "gapminder[gapminder$year ="
    
    gapminder[gapminder$year == 1957,]
    ```

  * Extract all columns except 1 through to 4:

    ```R
    gapminder[,-1:4]
    Error in .subset(x, j) : only 0's may be mixed with negative subscripts
    
    gapminder[,-(1:4)]
    ```

  * Extract the rows where the life expectancy is longer the 80 years:

  ```R
  gapminder[gapminder$lifeExp > 80]
  Error in `[.data.frame`(gapminder, gapminder$lifeExp > 80) : 
    undefined columns selected
    
  gapminder[gapminder$lifeExp > 80,]
  ```

  * Extract the first row, and the fourth and fifth columns (`lifeExp` and `gdpPercap`):

  ```R
  gapminder[1, 4, 5]
  [1] Asia
  Levels: Africa Americas Asia Europe Oceania
  
  gapminder[,c(1, 4, 5)]
  ```

  * Advanced: extract rows that contain information for the years 2002 and 2007:

  ```R
  gapminder[gapminder$year == 2002 | 2007,]
  
  gapminder[gapminder$year == 2002 | gapminder$year == 2007,]
  ```

* 6.6.2 Why does `gapminder[1:20]` return an error?  It only  has 7 columns. How does it differ from g`apminder[1:20, ]`? Comma indicates that you are seeking rows. Create a new `data.frame` called `gapminder_small` that only contains rows 1 through 9 and 19 through 23. You can do this in one or two steps.

```R
gapminder_small <- gapminder[c(1:9,19:23),]
```

* 6.6.3 Lookup in the help for the subsetting function. We can use this to subset a vector or a data frame, so to get the data only Botswana and for the year 1972 you might use:

```R
gapminder[gapminder$year == 1972 & gapminder$country == "Botswana","lifeExp"]
```

Using subset this would become:

```R
subset(gapminder,gapminder$year == 1972 & gapminder$country == "Botswana")
```

The following are equivalent:

```R
gapminder[gapminder$lifeExp < 30,c("country","year","lifeExp")]
subset(gapminder,lifeExp < 30,select=c("country","year","lifeExp"))
```

Use both methods to:

```R
# 1. Return rows of only the countries that are in Africa.
gapminder[gapminder$continent=="Africa",]

# 2. Return only the country column.
gapminder[gapminder$continent=="Africa","country"]

# 3. Use the unique() to make a unique list.
unique(gapminder[gapminder$continent=="Africa","country"])

# 4. How many unique African countries are listed in this data set? (52)
length(unique(gapminder[gapminder$continent=="Africa","country"]))
[1] 52

# 5. Do the same for Europe (30)
length(unique(gapminder[gapminder$continent=="Europe","country"]))
[1] 30

# 6. Americas (25)
length(unique(gapminder[gapminder$continent=="Americas","country"]))
[1] 25

# 7. Asia (33)
length(unique(gapminder[gapminder$continent=="Asia","country"]))
[1] 33

# 8. Oceania (2)
length(unique(gapminder[gapminder$continent=="Oceania","country"]))
[1] 2
```



## 7. Control flow

## 8. Quality graphics

* Modify the example so that the figure shows how life expectancy has changed over time:

  ```R
  ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point()
  ```

  ![Life expectancy against the GDP per capita.](imgs/gdpPercap.png)

  ```R
  ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point()
  ```

  **Hint**: the gapminder dataset has a column called “year”, which should appear on the x-axis.

  

  ![Life expectancy by year.](imgs/LifeExpVsYear.png)

* 8.1.2 In the previous examples and challenge we’ve used the `aes` function to tell the scatterplot geom about the x and y locations of each point. Another aesthetic property we can modify is the point colour. Modify the code from the previous challenge to color the points by the “continent” column. What trends do you see in the data? Are they what you expected?

* 8.2.1 Switch the order of the point and line layers from the previous example. What happened? i.e. points before lines:

  ```R
  ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, by=country)) +
    geom_point(colour="blue") +
    geom_line(aes(colour=continent))
  ```

![](/Users/mario/GitRepos/trieste/answers/imgs/LifeExpVsYearLines.png)

```R
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, by=country)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour=continent)) +
  geom_point(colour="blue")

```

![](/Users/mario/GitRepos/trieste/answers/imgs/LifeExpVsYearLines2.png)

## 9. Vectorisation

* 9.1.1 Create a new column in gapminder called `pop_millions` that takes the `pop` population and expresses it in units of a million (you can also use `gapminder$NewColumnName` to create a new column).

```R
gapminder2 <- cbind(gapminder,gapminder$pop/1000000)
gapminder$pop_millions <- gapminder$pop/1000000
```

* 9.1.2 On a single graph, plot population, in millions, against year, for all countries. Don’t worry about identifying which country is which.

  ```R
  ggplot(data=gapminder,aes(x=year,y=pop_millions)) +geom_point()
  ```

  ![Population by millions vs year](imgs/pop_millionsVsYear.png)

* 9.1.3 Repeat the exercise, graphing only for "China", "India", "Indonesia". Again, don’t worry about which is which.

  ```R
  ggplot(data=gapminder[gapminder$country %in% c("China", "India", "Indonesia"),],aes(x=year,y=pop_millions)) + geom_point()
  ```

  

  ![Population in millions only for China, India and Indonesia.](imgs/PopMillionVsYearSubset.png)

*  9.2.1 For the following matrix:

  ```R
  (m <- matrix(1:12, nrow=3, ncol=4))
       [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
  [1,]    1    4    7   10
  [2,]    2    5    8   11
  [3,]    3    6    9   12
  ```

  Predict what you will get **before** you execute the command:

  ```R
  m^-1
  m*c(1,0,-1)
  m>c(0,20)
  m * c(1, 0, -1, 2)
  
  m^-1 # Each element, a, becomes 1/1
            [,1]      [,2]      [,3]       [,4]
  [1,] 1.0000000 0.2500000 0.1428571 0.10000000
  [2,] 0.5000000 0.2000000 0.1250000 0.09090909
  [3,] 0.3333333 0.1666667 0.1111111 0.08333333
  
  m*c(1,0,-1) # Piecewise multiplication of vector along the column -
              # remember that the vector cycles.
       [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
  [1,]    1    4    7   10
  [2,]    0    0    0    0
  [3,]   -3   -6   -9  -12
  
  m>c(0,20) # picks the elements that are greater than 0 and 20 respectively
            # and then it cyles.
        [,1]  [,2]  [,3]  [,4]
  [1,]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE
  [2,] FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
  [3,]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE
  
  m * c(1, 0, -1, 2) # piecewise multiplication of the elements by the vector.
       [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
  [1,]    1    8   -7    0
  [2,]    0    5   16  -11
  [3,]   -3    0    9   24
  ```

  How many did you get right? Are there any outputs that you do not understand?

* 9.2.2 We’re interested in looking at the sum of the following sequence of fractions:

```
 x = 1/(1^2) + 1/(2^2) + 1/(3^2) + ... + 1/(n^2)
```

This would be tedious to type out, and impossible for high values of n. Use vectorisation to compute x when n=100. What is the sum when n=10,000? <br/>**Note**: there is a `sum()` function.

```R
sum((1:10000)^-1)
[1] 9.787606
```



## 10. Functions

* 10.2.1 Test the GDP function by calculating the GDP for New Zealand in 1987. How does this differ from New Zealand’s GDP in 1952?

* 10.2.2 The paste function can be used to combine text together, e.g:
```R
best_practice <- c("Write", "programs", "for", "people", "not", "computers")
paste(best_practice, collapse=" ")
```
 Write a function called `fence` that takes two vectors as arguments,  called text and wrapper, and prints out the text wrapped with the wrapper:
````R
  fence(text=best_practice, wrapper="***")
````
Note: the paste function has an argument called `sep`, which specifies the separator between text. The default is a space: “ “. The default for `paste0` is no space “”.

## 11. Writing data

* 11.1.1 Rewrite your `pdf` command to print a second page in the pdf, showing a facet plot (hint: use `facet_grid`) of the same data with one panel per continent.

* 11.1.2 Produce output to jpeg, use `jpeg()`. Note you will not do multipaged jpegs.

* 11.1.3 Produce output to png, use `png()`. Note you will not do multipaged jpegs.

* 11.1.4 Add the flag to your pdf() command `onefile=FALSE` *only* if you are using the `pdf()` output command and change the output filename to `Life_Exp_vs_time%03d.ext`  where `ext` is  `pdf`, `png` or `jpeg` depending on the output that you are using. What do you observe now?

* 11.2.1 Modify the write.table command so that:

    1. It does not print the rownames.
    2. It does not quote the character or factor columns.

  * 11.2.2 Write a data-cleaning script file that subsets the gapminder data to include only data points collected since 1990.

     Use this script to write out the new subset to a file in the `../cleaned-data/` directory.

## 12. Split-Apply-Combine

* 1.1 Calculate the average life expectancy per continent. 
      Which has the longest? Which had the shortest?
```R
ddply(.data=gapminder,
      .variables="continent",
      .fun=function(x){c(mean=mean(x$lifeExp))}
)
```

* 1.2 Calculate the average life expectancy per continent and year. 
  Which had the longest and shortest in 2007? Which had the greatest change in between 1952 and 2007?

```R
gap_year_cont<- ddply(.data=gapminder,
                      .variables = c("continent","year"),
                      .fun=function(x){c(mean=mean(x$lifeExp))})
```
* 1.3 Calculate the difference in mean life expectancy between the years 1952 and 2007 from the output of challenge 2 using one of the `plyr` functions.

```R
ddply(.data=gap_year_cont,
.variables = "continent",
.fun=function(x){c(lifexpDiff=x$mean[x$year==2007]-x$mean[x$year==1952])})
```

## 13. dplyr

* 13.1.1 Write a single command (which can span multiple lines and includes pipes) that will produce a dataframe that has the African values for `lifeExp`,  `country` and `year`, but not for other Continents. How many rows does your dataframe have and why?

```R
gapminder                   %>%
filter(continent=="Africa") %>%
select(year,country,lifeExp) -> lcy

nrow(gapminder)   # 1704
nrow(lcy)         #  624
```

* 13.2.1 Calculate the average life expectancy per country.
          Which has the longest average life expectancy and which has the shortest average life expectancy?

```R
gapminder                            %>%
group_by(country)                    %>%
summarize(AverageLife=mean(lifeExp)) %>%
filter(AverageLife==min(AverageLife)|AverageLife == max(AverageLife))
```

* 13.2.2 Do the same thing but using the `arrange()` and `desc()` functions.

```R
# For the min
gapminder                            %>%
group_by(country)                    %>%
summarize(AverageLife=mean(lifeExp)) %>%
arrange(AverageLife)

# For the max
gapminder                            %>%
group_by(country)                    %>%
summarize(AverageLife=mean(lifeExp)) %>%
arrange(desc(AverageLife))
```

* 13.3.1 Calculate the average life expectancy in 2002 of 2 randomly selected 
      countries for each continent. Then arrange the continent names in 
      reverse order.<br/>
      **Hint**: Use the `dplyr` functions `arrange()` and `sample_n()`, they have similar syntax to other `dplyr` functions.

```R
gapminder                                %>%
   filter(year==2002)                    %>%
   group_by(continent)                   %>%
   sample_n(2)                           %>%            # sample 2 rows per continent
   summarize(mean_lifeExp=mean(lifeExp)) %>%
   arrange(desc(mean_lifeExp))
```

## 14. tidyr

* 14.1 Is `gapminder` a purely long, purely wide, or some intermediate format?

* 14.2 Using `gap_long`, calculate the mean life expectancy, population, and `gdpPercap` for each continent. Hint: use the `group_by()` and `summarize()` functions we learned in the `dplyr` lesson

```R
gap_long %>% group_by(continent,obs_type) %>% summarise(mean=mean(obs_values))
```

## 15. Knitr

* 15.1 Remove the sections in your own markdown document and try some of the markdown objects described in the notes or in RStudio `Help -> Markdown Quick Reference`.

* 15.2 Add code chunks to your existing document that:
    * Loads the `ggplot2` package
    * Reads the `gapminder` data
    * Creates a plot

    ```R
    ​```{r read_and_plot_data}
       library(ggplot2)
       dat <- read.csv("../data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
       ggplot(data=dat,aes(x=year,y=pop,shape=continent)) +   
              geom_point()
    ​```
    ```
    
    ![Output of population by year.](imgs/ggplot_out.png)
    
    
    
* 15.3 Use chunk options to control the size of a figure and to hide the code.

* 15.4  Try out a bit of in-line R code.


## 16. R and SQL

* 16.1.1 Write a query that returns the number of rodents observed in each plot in each year.<br/>
         **Hint**: Connect to the species table and write a query that joins the species and survey tables together to exclude all non-rodents. The query should return counts of rodents by year.
```      R
(species <- tbl(mammals,"species"))
(species %>% 
       filter(taxa == "Rodent") %>%
        inner_join(surveys) %>%
        group_by(species,year) %>%
        tally() %>%
        collect() -> rodents)
```

* 16.1.2 Write a query that returns the total number of rodents in each genus caught in the different plot types.<br/>
  **Hint**: Write a query that joins the species, plot, and survey tables together.
            The query should return counts of genus by plot type.

```R
# There is nothing in species that we can join with plots so we 
# must perform a preliminary join between surveys and plots.
surveys %>% inner_join(plots) %>% select(species_id,plot_type)-> surveys_plots

(
species                           %>% 
       filter(taxa=="Rodent")     %>% 
       inner_join(surveys_plots)  %>%
       group_by(genus,plot_type)  %>%
       tally()                    %>%
       collect() -> rodentcount
)
# or
(
surveys_plots                    %>%
       inner_join(species)       %>%
       group_by(genus,plot_type) %>%
       tally()                   %>%
       collect() -> rodentcount
)

# The whole thing can be made more compact
(
inner_join(surveys,plots)              %>%   # Do the inner join
          select(species_id,plot_type) %>%   # Reduce the amount of output
          inner_join(species)          %>%   # Join with species
          group_by(genus,plot_type)    %>% 
          tally()                      %>%
          collect() -> rodentcount
)
```

* 16.2.1 Add the remaining species table to the my_db database and run some of your queries from earlier in the lesson to verify that you have faithfully recreated the mammals database.

```R
copy_to(my_db, myspecies,temporary = FALSE)
```
